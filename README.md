# TicTacToe

Very basic TicTacToe game.

Run the game on the console with the following command:

1
$ ruby example/example_game.rb
This program functions, but is fragile. It breaks when incorrect input is provided and if users move in a cell that is already occupied, they overwrite the previous move. This program would need improvements to be considered “production” grade, but it has followed good design principles that make future extensions and maintenance easy.
